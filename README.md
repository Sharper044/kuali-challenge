# KualiChallenge

This repo is a challenge that I am doing for Kuali Co. I am begining today, November 6th 2018, at 5:00 am.

Commit 1) Set up React. My reasoning here is that by using react's built in framework that I can use lifecycle methods to help save time. My plan is to set up a parent controller component that will set up the building and control the elevators. Then we will have individual elevator components. I would like to include setTimeouts to allow for interactivity.
